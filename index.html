            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Born and raised in Pennsylvania, Aciebabyy, known as "Scubby" to his family, was destined for a life of music from an early age. Lil Wayne was more than just an influence—he was a beacon of inspiration throughout the majority of Aciebabyy’s childhood. Wayne’s groundbreaking success and his ability to elevate artists like Drake and Nicki Minaj into the spotlight deeply resonated with a young Aciebabyy, shaping his vision of what a career in music could be. As a teenager, Drake, Nicki, and Kendrick became the soundtrack to his formative years, each pushing boundaries and bending genres, further igniting his belief that, as a Black man, he could explore any genre that stirred his soul—whether it be rap, rock, R&B, country, EDM, or beyond.

                While hip-hop battle rap gave Aciebabyy the adrenaline rush he craved, he never wanted to be confined to that arena. Instead, it became a tool to sharpen his skills as a wordsmith, adding layers of wit and complexity to his lyrics. The pandemic provided him with the perfect opportunity to dive deep into social media, where his raw talent quickly garnered a dedicated following. Now, with his unique blend of influences and a deep-seated passion for music, Aciebabyy is ready to step into the spotlight and share his multifaceted artistry with the world.</p>
